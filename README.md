# SICS-cite

This is a thesis project done at SICS. The overall goal of the project is to implement and evaluate a set of algorithms for citation analysis.

### Directories

The root-level dataset directories contain code related to the parsing of the datasets. Due to space limitations the datasets are not present on GitHub.

The only datasets that have been used in the rest of the project is AAN and APS.
